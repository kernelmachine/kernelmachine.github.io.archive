Here at Rapid7 we have incredible access to internet-scale data via projects Sonar[^1] and Heisenberg[^2].
Investigating these data gives us a birds eye view of the current state of the Internet, public scanning activity, and the network security landscape.

Recently, I've become interested in extending these resources to include maps of IPV4 allocation and network providers.

But first, a primer on IPv4, the fourth version of the Internet Protocol.

The birth of the Internet, nicely documented by various books[^3], involved the allocation of a fixed number of IP addresses. Because IPV4 addresses are 32-bit, IPV4 contains:

$$ 2^{32} = 4, 294, 967, 296 \text{ IP addresses.}$$

Public demand for IP addresses lead to the exhaustion of allocable IPv4 addresses in 2011, something thought impossible at the Internet's inception.

In fact, the Internet is a large marketplace of territory. Service providers sell continguous sets of IP addresses at fixes prices that depend on the number of IP addresses in the block.

Let's take a look at the process of splitting an IP block. An IP block has two components: a base address and a prefix. The base address is fixed, and the prefix is a mask that determines how many variants of the base address exist in the block.

For example, an IP address: 127.3.25/25 is denoted by the following prefix and address:

$$ \text { 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 }  \text { 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 } \text { 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 } \text { 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 } $$

$$ \text {  0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0  }  \text { 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 } \text { 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 } \text { 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 } $$

To split this IP block in half, we simply increment the prefix to 26, resulting in the following prefix and address:

$$ \text { 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 }  \text { 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 } \text { 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 } \text { 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 } $$

$$ \text {  0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0  }  \text { 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 } \text { 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 } \text { 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 } $$

The mask locks the IP address bit to a value, so a larger prefix implies a smaller set of routable space for IP blocks. What does this all suggest?

Security incident response commonly involves looking at origin autonomous system of a malicious link. The distribution of autonomous systems across the Internet follows a particularly interesting map:

  *IPV4 MAP*

We can look at the maximum number of routable addresses in each AS with the following code:

{% highlight python %}

def as_size(self,asn):

    ipblock = self.as_block(asn)

    if ipblock is None:

        return None

    mask_lengths = [ip.split('/')[1] for ip in ipblock]

    sizes = map(lambda x: 2 ** (32 - int(x)), mask_lengths)

    return sum(sizes)

{% endhighlight %}

*FIGURE*

However, due to the frequent splitting of IP blocks we must remember that a *large AS does not necessarily suggest a large IP block*. For either the large AS could have a few large IP blocks, or a ton of small ones.

Let's take a look at an AS that has split since 2007:

*FIGURE*

Phishing sites pulled from cleanmx[^4] show up more often when the IP blocks are smaller.
