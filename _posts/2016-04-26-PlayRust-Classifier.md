Written with @staticassert.

Interest in Rust as a scientific computing platform has been propagated by the number of data science and machine learning crates that have sprung up.
But one question we found ourselves asking was, how does Rust perform in the wild? Where are its strengths and deficiencies? We felt the best way to answer
these questions was to complete a full data science project in Rust, coded in Rust from start to finish - data collection, analysis, model generation, and prediction.

What better problem than on that gives back to the community we love so?

Here's what we set out to accomplish: build and test a binary classification model that can classify novel rust subreddit posts as being a part of the rust subreddit, or playrust subreddit.

## Data collection

## Data cleaning

## Data encoding

## Model generation

## Model prediction
