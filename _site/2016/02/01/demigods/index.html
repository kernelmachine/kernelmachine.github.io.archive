  <p>Hi there, I’m Suchin. I’m a data scientist at Rapid7, a security company in Cambridge, MA.</p>

<p>My career and explorations revolve around building scalable and reliable machine learning
services. It is the building of systems that can make intelligent decisions based on a wide
variety of data.</p>

<p>So why write?</p>

<p>Many authors of research or academic background formulate their thesis of writing as something that allows them to <em>teach others</em>. While I agree and probably extend this valid thesis to this blog, letting it serve as a medium to expose the larger community to personal endeavors, this blog stems primarily from another desire.</p>

<p>This alternate desire  by the internal battle I face: It has taken me a while to start writing again. I open a word processor, and close it. I pick up a pen, and drop it. It has been curious to me, this apparent blocking force. As a software developer, I write <em>code</em> naturally, a language of the machine. But why is it so difficult to write the language of humans so naturally? Why does the urge to write in English pervade me?</p>

<p>One may think that the language of the machine is less open to subjectivity, confined to the narrow logic of conditionals. But there is a difference between code and <em>beautiful</em> code, one that extends beyond the tricks of syntax rules. To choose a less elegant form to make it easier to read, to optimize functions based on the end purpose of the program, to convert a 10 line function to a one-liner: there is beauty.</p>

<p>This blog exists because I see writing a post as
Content will vary from security and machine learning, to short stories, to a wide variety
of interests like social justice to neuroscience. This blog exists for both the author and the reader. For the author, this blog serves as personal documentation na medium for honing command over the written word. For the reader, another perspective on the Internet, and perhaps a way to learn some new things.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, I’m interested in exploring how to build scalable and reliable machine learning services.</p>

<hr />

<p>Poole is the butler for <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, the static site generator. It’s designed and developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a> to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.</p>

<p>There are currently two themes built on Poole:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com">Hyde</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com">Lanyon</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whats-included">What’s included</h3>

<p>Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it, includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, <a href="/404.html">404</a>, <a href="/atom.xml">RSS feed</a>, posts, and <a href="/about">example page</a>)</li>
  <li>Mobile friendly design and development</li>
  <li>Easily scalable text and component sizing with <code class="highlighter-rouge">rem</code> units in the CSS</li>
  <li>Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements</li>
  <li>Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post</li>
  <li>Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional features are available in individual themes.</p>

<h3 id="browser-support">Browser support</h3>

<p>Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.</p>
