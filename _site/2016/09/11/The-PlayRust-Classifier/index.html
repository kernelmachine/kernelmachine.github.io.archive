  <time datetime="2016-09-11T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">11 Sep 2016</time>
  <p>It’s been a while since my last post – a product of an insane summer. I got a new job, moved across the country, and gave a talk at RustConf yesterday, which required a lot of preparation. To inaugurate things (hopefully) settling down for the next few months, I wanted to start blogging again! Here’s a little essay around my experience at RustConf, as well as a little dive into the talk that <em>staticassert</em> and I gave around Rust machine learning.</p>

<h3 id="data-science-technical-debt">Data Science Technical Debt</h3>

<p>When Colin and I worked at Rapid7 together,  that (in a nutshell) tried</p>

<p>Our talk at RustConf dealt with technical debt that we’ve experienced as developers in data science. A crucial motivator for us was a paper from Google that came out in 2014 called <strong>Machine Learning: The High Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt</strong>, which describes the unique difficulties of creating production-level machine learning systems that tend to get neglected under the hype of AI.</p>

<p>People tend to believe that machine learning <em>models</em> are the real bottleneck to reliable AI. And this may be true in domains like vision and natural language, in which data is abundant and relatively clean. However, applications of data science in virtually any other domain requires significant data wrangling, which is best summarized by the following:</p>

<p>Data almost always sucks in <em>some</em> way. It’s either biased, missing, dirty, unexpected, short-lived – I could go on forever. This means that 99% of a data scientists time is spent doing <em>feature engineering</em> rather than actual machine learning.</p>

<p>Furthermore, movement from research to production involves an incredible amount of technical debt:</p>

<p>1) <em>Siloed teams</em>
2) <em>Pipeline Jungles</em>
3) <em>Unscalable Experiments</em></p>

<p>This is on top of <em>all the other technical debt</em> that any engineer is used to. Undocumented code, Invisible Errors, etc.</p>

<p>There are many other sources of technical debt that we don’t outline in the talk. This includes:</p>

<p>1) <em>Glue code</em>
2) <em>BLAH</em>
3) <em>BLAH</em></p>

<p>In general an ML system might contain only a <em>minority</em> amount of machine learning code, majority amount data wrangling.</p>

<p>Long story short - building scalable machine learning systems from POC research is extremely difficult. ML services are not only dependent on the quality of models,  but also the quality of <em>feature engineering</em> and <em>data ingestion</em>.</p>

<p>The first annual RustConf was an incredible experience. It’s exciting to be a part of a community that values inclusiveness and empowerment above most everything else. It’s also humbling to be surround by brilliant people who are as interested in teaching others as they are pushing the bounds of programming.</p>

<p>Colin (<em>staticassert</em>) and my talk was around
Rust in 2017 looks like it’s going to be really exciting, as Niko and Aaron mentioned in their keynote. Really glad to have met so many cool people! Keep in touch :)</p>
