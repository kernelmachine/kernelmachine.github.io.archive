I am a masters student in natural language processing at the University of Washington, advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/). 

My current research involves multilingual representation learning and generative modeling. I'm interested in how we can share and transfer the structure of text across multiple languages.

Before graduate school, I was a data scientist and software engineer at several enterprises in Seattle and Boston. I built scalable, persistent machine learning systems for venture capital, security, and churn prediction. I particularly enjoy the intersection of engineering and machine learning.

Before that, I did research in computational neuroscience. I worked on mapping the neocortex and building brain-machine interfaces.
