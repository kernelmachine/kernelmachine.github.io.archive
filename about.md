I'm Suchin. I'm a data scientist at Rapid7, a security company in Cambridge, MA.

This blog will condense and communicate things I read about. It's a way for me to understand
material and practice writing, and for readers to learn something new.

Topics will be all over the place: machine learning to security, programming to novels.
With time, I hope to hone a voice.

Thanks for reading!
