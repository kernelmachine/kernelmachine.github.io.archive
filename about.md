I am a young investigator in natural language processing (NLP) at the [Allen Institute for AI](http://allenai.org). I work on the [AllenNLP](http://allennlp.org) team, where we are building an open-source platform for performing and packaging research in deep learning and NLP.

I completed my masters in NLP at the University of Washington. My thesis was on *Polyglot Text Classification with Neural Document Models* -- performing text classification in many languages using crosslingual parameter sharing and unlabeled data. I also helped unravel [fundamental biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02324) in NLP datasets that inflate our success on difficult AI tasks.

Before graduate school, I was a data scientist and software engineer at several enterprises in Seattle and Boston. I worked on scalable machine learning products for venture capital, security, and churn prediction. I particularly enjoy the unique intersection of software engineering and machine learning.

Before that, I did research in computational neuroscience. I worked on data-intensive research in [mapping the neocortex](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003710) and building [brain-machine interfaces](https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00982.2016).
